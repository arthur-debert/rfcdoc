TxtDoc Format Example
--------------------

This is a sample TxtDoc file that demonstrates the various formatting features.

A Section About Lists

Lists can be created in several ways:

- This is a bullet point
- Another bullet point
    - Indented bullet point

Numbered lists use different formats:

    1. Top level item
        a. Second level item
        b. Another second level item
            i. Third level item
            ii. Another third level item

Code Blocks

Code blocks are indented with 4 spaces:

    function helloWorld() {
        console.log("Hello, world!");
        return true;
    }

Quotes

Quotes use the > character:

> This is a quoted line.
>> This is a nested quoted line.

Emphasis

Use _underscores_ to emphasize important text.

_Note_: This is an important note.

Paragraphs

Paragraphs are separated by blank lines.

This is a new paragraph.
