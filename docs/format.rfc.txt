This project uses txt for docs, mostly following the old-school unix guidelines.

1. Plain Text Only: 
    
   No rich text formatting (no bold, italics, colors, etc.).

2. Limited Line Length:

   80 chars, must be soft wrapped.

3. Headers:

   Use clear, concise headers to organize content.

4. Whitespace:

   Use consistent spacing and indentation for readability.

5. Paragraphs:
    
   Separate paragraphs with blank lines.

6. Lists:

   Use - for bullet points. Indent sub-lists with spaces. Numbered lists use 
   numerical, then letter, then roman numeral. Such as:

    1. Top List
        a. Second level
        b. Moar nesting
            i. Then roman

   Don't nest lists > 3 levels.

7. Code Blocks:

   Indent code blocks with 4 spaces (or a tab, which is often configured to 4 spaces).

   This preserves the code's structure.
   Example:

    int main(void) {
        printf("Hello, world!\n");
        return 0;
    }


8. Quotes:

   Use > to indicate quoted text.
   Multiple > characters indicate nested quotes.

   Example:

   > This is a quoted line.
   >> This is a nested quoted line.


9. Emphasis:

   Use _ to indicate emphasis.

   Example:
    
    _Note_

10. Bold: 

    Use * (single asterisk) to indicate bold text.

11. Sessions:

    Sessions are defined in three ways:

    11.a. Formal Session Declaration

    Session Name
    ------------ 
    
    That is, a single line, preceded by an empty line and succeeded by a line of 
    dashes. At least 2 dashes must be present, the formatter should match the 
    number of dashes in the line above. The dash line must be followed by an 
    empty line.

    11.b. Numbered Session Declaration

    Same as 11.a but without the dashes and with some numbering, as in:

    1. Session Name

    1.1 Session Name

    Note: To distinguish from regular numbered lists, numbered sessions MUST:
    - Be preceded by an empty line
    - Have no indentation
    - Contain only the number, period, space, and title
    - Not be part of a sequence of list items

    11.c. Alternative Declaration

    If no dashes nor single lines are present, a session is defined by a colon + 
    single line, preceded by an empty line and succeeded by an empty line.
    The colon must be at the beginning of the line with no preceding spaces.

    : Session Name

12. References: 

    The editor can index and link documents and sections from the internal doc 
    representations. Sessions serve as anchors where the anchor ID follows these rules:
    - Convert all text to lowercase
    - Remove non-alphanumeric characters except spaces
    - Convert spaces to dashes
    
    To link to a section:
    
    see: docs/format.rfc.txt#11-a (file path + # + anchor ID)

    The extension will validate links on save and provide autocomplete suggestions.

13. Footnotes:

    Footnotes are referenced by using the following syntax:

    See footnote [1] 

    and declared at the end of the document, as in:

    [1] This is a footnote

    The extension will automatically number the footnotes and create the 
    reference links.

14. Advanced Formatting:

    14.a. Tables:
    Not supported in this format. Use pre-formatted text with spaces or code blocks.

    14.b. Images:
    Not supported directly. Store images separately and reference their location.


15. Implementation Notes:

    15.a. Extension Features:
    - Syntax highlighting for this format
    - Section folding
    - Navigation to references/anchors
    - Footnote management
    - Basic formatting commands

    15.b. Parsing Strategy:
    The parser should use a line-by-line approach, tracking context (lists,
    code blocks, etc.) as it processes text.

16. Optional Format Elements:

    16.a. Metadata Headers
    
    Key-value metadata can be placed at the beginning or end of the document:
    - One pair per line
    - Field name on left, value on right
    - At least 2 spaces separating field name and value
    - Left-aligned field names, values can be right-aligned for visual appeal
    
    Example:
    
    Network Working Group                                         S. Bradner
    Request for Comments: 2026                            Harvard University
    BCP: 9                                                      October 1996
    Obsoletes: 1602
    
    16.b. Document Title
    
    A centered document title can be placed near the top of the document,
    typically after metadata headers and before the main content:
    
    Example:
    
    Network Working Group                                         S. Bradner
    // ...other metadata...
    
    
                  The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3
    
    
    16.c. Table of Contents
    
    A table of contents can be included with section numbers and optional page 
    numbers:
    - Begins with "Table of Contents" header
    - Each entry includes section number, title, and optional page number
    - Nested sections are indented
    - Dots typically connect the title to the page number
    
    Example:
    
    Table of Contents
    
       1.  INTRODUCTION....................................................2
         1.1  Internet Standards...........................................3
         1.2  The Internet Standards Process...............................3
         1.3  Organization of This Document................................5
       2.  INTERNET STANDARDS-RELATED PUBLICATIONS.........................5
         2.1  Requests for Comments (RFCs).................................5
    
    The extension provides a command to generate a TOC automatically based on
    the document's sessions. The TOC title is configurable in extension settings.
    
    TOCs are optional but recommended for longer documents.

17. Extension Commands:

    17.a. Format Document
    Applies consistent formatting according to this specification.
    
    17.b. Generate TOC
    Creates or updates a table of contents based on document sessions.
    
    
    17.c. Number Footnotes
    Automatically numbers footnotes and ensures references are correct.

    17.d Full Formatting
    Applies commands that preceed this including metadata, title, TOC, and footnotes.

    17.e Checks that all document references point to valid targets. (not part of full formatting)
