This document demonstrates all the syntax features of the RFC format.

1. Numbered Sections

   Numbered sections use the format "1. Section Name" and can be nested.
   
   1.1 Nested Section Level 1
   
       This is a code block inside a nested section.
       Code blocks are indented with 4 spaces.
       They preserve formatting and are useful for examples.
   
   1.2 Another Nested Section
   
       function testCode() {
           console.log("This is a code example");
           return true;
       }
   
   1.3 Lists Inside Sections
   
       - Bullet point 1
       - Bullet point 2
       - Bullet point 3
       
       1. Numbered list item 1
       2. Numbered list item 2
       3. Numbered list item 3
       
       a. Lettered list item a
       b. Lettered list item b
       
       i. Roman numeral list item i
       ii. Roman numeral list item ii

2. Text Formatting

   2.1 Bold Text
   
       *This text is bold* and this text is not.
       
       You can use *bold* for emphasis within a paragraph.
   
   2.2 Italic Text
   
       _This text is italic_ and this text is not.
       
       You can use _italic_ for subtle emphasis within a paragraph.
   
   2.3 Combined Formatting
   
       You can combine *bold* and _italic_ formatting in the same paragraph.
       
       However, nesting formats like *_nested_* is not supported.

3. References and Links

   3.1 Document References
   
       You can reference other documents using the see: syntax:
       
       see: format.rfc.txt
       
       Or reference specific sections with anchors:
       
       see: format.rfc.txt#section-2
   
   3.2 Footnotes
   
       You can add footnotes to your document [1] and reference them
       multiple times [2] as needed.

4. Quotes and Blockquotes

   4.1 Simple Quotes
   
       > This is a simple quote.
       > It can span multiple lines.
   
   4.2 Nested Quotes
   
       > This is a top-level quote.
       >> This is a nested quote.
       > Back to the top-level quote.

: Alternative Section Format

   This section uses the alternative format with a colon.
   
   It's useful for special sections that don't fit the numbered hierarchy.

UPPERCASE SECTION FORMAT

   This section uses the traditional uppercase format.
   
   It's still supported for backward compatibility.

ARROWS AND SPECIAL CHARACTERS

   The extension supports automatic conversion of arrow notation:
   
   -> becomes →
   <- becomes ←
   ^- becomes ↑
   v- becomes ↓

EMOTICONS

   The extension supports emoticon shortcuts:
   
   :smile: becomes 🙂
   :laugh: becomes 😄
   :sad: becomes ☹️

FOOTNOTES

[1] This is the first footnote. Footnotes can contain detailed information that would disrupt the flow of the main text.

[2] This is the second footnote. Footnotes are numbered sequentially.
