This project uses txt for docs, mostly follwoing the old-schol unix guidelines

1. Plain Text Only: No rich text formatting (no bold, italics, colors, etc.).

2. Fixed-Width Fonts: Expect that readers will use a fixed-width font (like Courier New or Monospace) for proper alignment.
3. Limited Line Length: Typically, lines are kept to 80 characters maximum to avoid wrapping issues in various email clients.

4 Titles and sections

This is a title
---------------

A Section

5.  Separate paragraphs with blank lines.

6. Lists:

Use  - for  bullet points.  Indent sub-lists with spaces.  Numbered lists use numerical, them letter then numeral. Such as 

    1. Top List
        a. Second level
        b. Moar nesting
            i. Then roman

Don't nest lists > 3 levels.

7. Code Blocks:

Indent code blocks with 4 spaces (or a tab, which is often configured to 4 spaces).

This preserves the code's structure.
Example:

    int main(void) {
        printf("Hello, world!\n");
        return 0;
    }


8. Quotes:

Use > to indicate quoted text.
Multiple > characters indicate nested quotes.

Example:

> This is a quoted line.
>> This is a nested quoted line.


9. Emphasis:
Use  _ to indicate emphasis

Example:
    
    _Note_
