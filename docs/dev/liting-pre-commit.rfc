This project uses Husky and lint-staged to enforce code quality standards before commits:

- *Linting*: All TypeScript files are automatically linted and fixed using ESLint
- *Formatting*: Markdown, JSON, and YAML files are automatically formatted using Prettier
- *Unit Tests*: All unit tests must pass before a commit is allowed

To skip the pre-commit hooks in exceptional cases (not recommended), use:

    #: bash
    git commit -m "Your message" --no-verify
